    policies.kyverno.io/description: |
      Prevents accidental and automatic deletion of Certificate resources managed by cert-manager.
      Certificates are critical for TLS security and should only be deleted manually
      after careful consideration. This policy blocks all DELETE operations unless
      the certificate has the explicit annotation 'cert-manager.io/allow-deletion: true'.
      This ensures only manual, intentional deletions are allowed.
