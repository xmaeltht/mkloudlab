# Tailscale Subnet Router with Host Network
# This advertises the cluster's internal network to Tailscale,
# allowing remote access to cluster services via their MetalLB LoadBalancer IPs
#
# IMPORTANT: The connector StatefulSet must be manually patched with hostNetwork: true
# to access MetalLB IPs which are only available on the host network, not the pod network.
#
# After applying this file, run:
# kubectl patch statefulset <sts-name> -n tailscale --type='json' \
#   -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/template/spec/hostNetwork", "value": true},
#        {"op": "add", "path": "/spec/template/spec/dnsPolicy", "value": "ClusterFirstWithHostNet"}]'
